# Project Title
## Work Day Scheduler

## Description
We were provided starter code. The objective is to come up with a logic to set the background to each time section based on past, present, and future using dayJS. We also have to utilize localStorage by allowing the user to enter an event in any specific time and have it show even when the page reloads by doing localStorage.getItem. The user should be able to change/update an event. The current day should show on the top below the title.
